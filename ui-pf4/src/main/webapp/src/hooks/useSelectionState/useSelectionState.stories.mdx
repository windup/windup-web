# useSelectionState

A custom hook for managing a subset of an array which represents the user's current selection of items in that array.
Can be used for a set of selected checkboxes, a set of expanded rows in an expandable table, and more.

Supports passing a TypeScript type for the array items using [generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html).

<!-- Not sure if there is a way to pull in this signature from the source automatically, that'd be better -->

```ts
// Syntax:
const selectionState = useSelectionState<T>(args: ISelectionStateArgs<T>);

// Arguments:
interface ISelectionStateArgs<T> {
  items: T[];
  initialSelected?: T[]; // Defaults to []
  isEqual?: (a: T, b: T) => boolean; // Defaults to (a, b) => a === b
}

// Return value:
interface ISelectionState<T> {
  selectedItems: T[];
  isItemSelected: (item: T) => boolean;
  toggleItemSelected: (item: T, isSelecting?: boolean) => void;
  areAllSelected: boolean;
  selectAll: (isSelecting?: boolean) => void;
  setSelectedItems: (items: T[]) => void;
}
```

The hook keeps references to your actual item objects instead of an id or key in its state, so that the
resulting `selectedItems` array contains all relevant context for use in e.g. form submission.
It returns state and functions you can use to inspect and update the selections.

In your component, you can use `isItemSelected(item)` when rendering the selected state of an item.
`isItemSelected` uses the hook's `isEqual` argument to compare the given item with the selected items.
By default, this uses referential equality (`===`), which works great if you're working with immutable data.

However, **if your item objects can change between renders, you need to specify an alternate implementation of the `isEqual` argument.**
For example, if your items have `id` properties, you can use `isEqual: (a, b) => a.id === b.id`.
